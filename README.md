## About
I work on applied machine learning problems across **time series forecasting, computer vision, and NLP**.  
My focus is on **end-to-end systems** — from data collection and modeling to evaluation and deployment.

I prioritize:
• Real datasets  
• Measurable metrics  
• Deployable pipelines
